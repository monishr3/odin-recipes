# odin-recipes

This project has a home page that has links for three recipes that can be made. Each recipe page has the recipe title, a link back to the home page, an image of the finished dish, a brief decription of the recipe, the ingredients needed for the recipe, and the steps to make the recipe. 

This project incorporated basic HTML in regards to the boilerplate and various tags. These tags included the header, link, parapgraph, images, unordered and ordered lists, list element, and break tags.
